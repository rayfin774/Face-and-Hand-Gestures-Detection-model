All About T MY  Face and Hand Gesture Recognition Model

This project is a real-time face and hand gesture recognition system developed using Python, 
MediaPipe, and OpenCV. It detects both facial expressions and hand gestures simultaneously from 
live webcam input and provides output based on the combined reaction. The system was trained on 
custom data and achieved an accuracy of 97%. It can recognize multiple face expressions such as happy, 
sad, and angry, along with hand gestures like thumbs up, peace, pointing, and open hand. The project
demonstrates the integration of computer vision and machine learning for human–computer interaction 
applications.
